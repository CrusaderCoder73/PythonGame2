# PythonGame2
In this project I implemented a game using pygame that uses sprites and Object Oriented Progamming concepts.
The game is pretty basic all it does is it puts a bunch of targets on a screen and allows the player to shoot them with a sound effect.

I used this youtube video to help me learn about sprites in pygame as well as some code:

Here is the site for all of the images I used in the game:
